##  Track: Data, Representation, and Access in Tracking

> "Self-experimentation with data forces us to wrestle with the uncertain line between evidence and belief and how we come to decisions about what is and is not legitimate knowledge." - Neff & Nafus. The Self-Tracking (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series) The MIT Press. 

This week in Quant Humanists, we will be thinking about representation and access in the world of self-tracking. Who are the target groups for these technologies? How do companies see the people they are looking to service? Who benefits (or is disadvantaged) because of self-tracking versus who could really use such technologies? How are people finding their own ways to track when the right tools don’t exist or when the larger institutional forces oppose them? How do we access the data we produce and what is its value?

## ASSIGNMENT 2 (DUE: WEEK `03`, 5 FEB 2018)

Last week we scoured our tools and services for data that has and is being produced about us. This week, we will continue with our focus on tracking but rather shift our attention to collecting data more intentionally with the use of our own homebrewed sensing solutions. Rather than be at the mercy of a company or organization, we will build our own tracking tools (and eventually our own tools to explore our data more visually).
