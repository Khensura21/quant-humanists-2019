### AGENDA

- Attendance

## Final Project Development

Begin/continue working on your final projects. We will look in more detail at the below materials next week, but if you're keen, you should have a look.

### Methods for Moving forward
- Read - you'll never regret a little bit extra reading and refining your literature reviews. Looking into how people have framed their projects or research can help you articulate your own questions. 
- Storyboarding and wireframing
- Define a style visual style guide (see below)
- Create a proof of concept using dummy or simulated data -- create a methodology for simulating data and then use that to create a proof of concept for your project (e.g. whether it is a visualization or otherwise)
  - e.g.: https://scotch.io/tutorials/generate-fake-data-for-your-javascript-applications-using-faker
  - e.g.: https://p5js.org/examples/math-noise-wave.html

- *About*: Create a style guide for your final project. 
- It doesn't have to be as detailed as this [one](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2014/03/12/datavizguide/) but it should have a few main sections, and you might take a look at the [duo linguo style guide](https://www.duolingo.com/design/) for inspiration:
