> “...every time you consider anything less any everything you are missing something...” - J. Paul Neeley

This week in Quant Humanists, we will look into the service of self-tracking. What do people’s journeys look like through the process of self-tracking? Who are the actors involved? What does engagement look like from the perspective of the product or software company or the quant self community? We will take the services we have been using as examples to understand the “quantified self as a service” and think through some service concept proposals based around the insights and data we’ve been tracking.

## ASSIGNMENT

**No assignment due!**

You should take this week to look through the practice materials, reading materials, and additional resources. These may serve you well in planning for your final projects and thinking through what it means to do "due diligence" in creating the specifications of a service. Pay particular attention to what it means to create evidence of a service and the ways that you can use those evidence to test out or develop scenarios (e.g. through video or live performance) to make your idea tangible and referenceable.

You should also take this week to practice your web skills with express.js.
