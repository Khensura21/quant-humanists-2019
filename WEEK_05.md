# WEEK `05`: MAR 04  2019
## Act: Quant Self as a Service 

> 

This week in Quant Humanists, we will look into the service of self-tracking. What do people’s journeys look like through the process of self-tracking? Who are the actors involved? What does engagement look like from the perspective of the product or software company or the quant self community? We will take the services we have been using as examples to understand the “quantified self as a service” and think through some service concept proposals based around the insights and data we’ve been tracking.
