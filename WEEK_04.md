# WEEK `04`: FEB 25 2019
## Reflect: Understanding Our Signals

> "The line between ourselves and our data is where we choose to draw it" - Neff & Nafus, The Self-Tracking

This week we're going to take some more time to think about APIs and how they provide a foundation for thinking about our tracking and data collection. We introduce some more foundational knowlege about APIs and build from some starter code to work with some biometric data (e.g. our photos) along with contextual data that may provide more insight into our data selves.

## ASSIGNMENT 4 (DUE: WEEK `05`, 04 MAR 2019): Drawing Connections

For this week's assignment, we are going to continue our practice of working with client and server side interactions as a way to collect and visualize data about ourselves. 

**Your assignment**

Using this starter code -- https://github.com/joeyklee/data-selfie-app -- or building your application from scratch, you will create an application that makes multiple API calls such that each time you submit data to your application your service allows you to submit your location and an image via an api to a server you've built. 

**Required**

Your task is to:

- submit data to your local data store each day; preferably more often, but at least once a day. 
- write about your experiences and methods for data submission in a blog post with images and documentation of your process and outcomes.

The focus of this exercise is to get you in to the practice of "checking in". You may find appropriate methods for reminding you to submit data. A calendar ping perhaps? Or an alarm set for every 6 hours? Randomly?

This is also an opportunity for you to practice building APIs and communicating with them with small, client side applications. 


**Optional, but highly encouraged**

To enhance your data submissions you may consider: 
- to add at least 1 additional data submission to your POST requests (e.g. from a form input or another method perhaps?).  Using your skills, you should consider submitting or gathering other data to your database that may provide context or specifically targets a variable of interest. Examples include:
  - weather
  - form inputs, numerical, truthy/falsy, qualitative/descriptive.
  - other derived or original inputs?
- You may also consider making some kind of other visualizaiton or perhaps more analytical exploration of your collected data. We will discuss this more next week.
- As you're submitting these data, you can start to think of ways you might start to draw relations between your contextual data (e.g. location, weather), and the other data you're deliberately tracking.

- **Submission**: Submit your Github Gist/blog post link as a [`comment in its respective github issue` in the quant-humanists-2019 repository](https://github.com/joeyklee/quant-humanists-2019/issues). See NOTE below.

**NOTE**: Please structure your blog post submissions according to the assignment template here: [Quant Humanist - assignment template](https://github.com/joeyklee/quant-humanists-2019/blob/master/_templates/assignment-submission-template.md)  


Challenge: use the weather-js npm module to make a get request to msn weather each time you submit your image and location from the client. Append the weather data to your incoming submission and show that data on your "log" page.
