# WEEK `07-2` MAKE UP CLASS: MAR 26, 2019
## Exercises + Review

This session we will spend some time to review what we've learned up to this point and walk through together the process of getting your self-tracking applications up and on the web. 


## Agenda

- **Final project proposal + AMA (ask me anything)**: As a reminder will go over what you will need to do for final project proposals (instructions are also online)
  - https://github.com/joeyklee/quant-humanists-2019/blob/master/final-project.md
- **Express Simple Authentication and deployment walkthrough**: Let's go over the express simple authentication example with mongodb and walk through how to deploy this to Heroku.
  - https://github.com/joeyklee/very-basic-express-auth-example/tree/with-mongodb
  - let's do a live coding video for this for archival :) 
- **Project highlights**: Let's go through some of the project videos from last week that we didnâ€™t manage to watch together. 
  - Professional Sharing, Yosuke Ushigome & takram london: https://www.takram.com/projects/professional-sharing/
  - Uninvited Guests, Superflux: https://vimeo.com/128873380
  - New: Project Alias, Bjorn Karman - http://bjoernkarmann.dk/project_alias
  - New: Camera Restrica, Philipp Schmitt - https://philippschmitt.com/work/camera-restricta
- **Quick pointer to physical data logging device**: should you have the hankering to build a more physical device, you may consider using this starter instructions to build a more physically computing data tracker. I can only give you limited feedback hee since pComp is not my fortÃ© but you're welcome to explore a more physical data collection and feedback tool if your heart desires.

- **Quick pointer to Siri Shortcuts App & MacroDroid**: this past week, we came to know Siri Shortcuts app for iOS and MacroDroid for android phones. Let's have a quick peek at these to see what kinds of workflows we might be able to think up and how coming up with these kinds of workflows could helpful for others building self-tracking tools. If you build a cool one, maybe it is worth sharing with the quant self community?
- **Britecharts.js Demo**: At some point you may want to build nice interactive charts without the huff and puff of having to define your own complex transitions and events. There are a bunch of charting libriaries that attempt to make our lives easier while still allowing for customization. I can recommend britecharts and chart.js but similar libraries also include: https://eventbrite.github.io/britecharts/, https://naver.github.io/billboard.js/, or    https://plot.ly/javascript/, https://www.chartjs.org/
